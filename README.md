# The Bird Lovers Club

A club for people who love birds, in particular those who live in urban settings. Our mission is to empower people to connect with birds and make that more accessible and inclusive to all by taking a very laid back approach to it. 
Anybody can be a birder and we want to emphasise that it's open to all age groups, social backgrounds, health conditions etc, all we need to do is to stop, listen and watch.

By offering an online platform with introductory informations, various resources and organising events that are about birds, our objective is to enable people to bond with birds and get together with like minded indiviuals. We believe that that connection can happen not just in the countryside and that you don't need any fancy equipments to get out there and watch birds. In fact, all you need is an willingness to slow down and observe them with your senses. This in turn can potentially be hugely beneficial to our mental health. 

We want to bring people together, get outdoors, connect with our feathered friends and get creative and inspired by the magic those animals can offer us on a daily basis.
