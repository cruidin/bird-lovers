Introduction

The Bird Lovers Club is a personal art project in the format of a website. It is about my journey and relationship with birds in general but with a focus on my encounters with birds in Ireland, where I’ve been living for the last decade. In it I share my bird adventures through my drawings and stories and I invite people to join me in my appreciation for those creatures.

I take a very simple and laid back approach to birding and this is reflected in the design style I created for this project. Since it is not only just a coding project but also an artistic one, the aim is to showcase my drawings and stories to an audience of primarily art and bird lovers.

This project was conceived as a response to our first Milestone Project at The Code Institute for their Full Stack Web Development Program. It comprises of a responsive and static website with 4 pages using HTML5 and CSS.

Development Planes
This was tricky. Even though I knew from the beginning that I wanted to make a website about birds, I still spent over two weeks trying to come up with a plan. Originally I intended to make this more informative but given that there are tons of comprehensive resources out there my project naturally evolved into an art piece.

Structure
￼

Skeleton
I used good old pencil on paper for the wireframe of the main page first, then I had a go at Balsamiq and before I started coding I drew the website on the iPad to get a better idea of what I wanted to achieve in terms of colours, layout and design style.

Design

Colour Scheme

I used a combination of different soft shades of green and pink as well as a deep dark somber share of brown for contrast. Those colours were chosen to reflect the easy going nature of the drawings and stories and also to communicate pleasantness.
￼
Typography
The fonts used were Roboto and Girassol, with Helvetica as a fall back.

Illustrations

All illustrations were made but me for the purpose of this project. There are essentially two different styles of illustrations, both are digital and were made on Procrete, iPad. The more simplistic ones are found throughout the website and are mostly simple outline drawings in very dark brown. The main image present on all pages are coloured. On birds.html the style used is more realistic made in a quick sketch style with more accurate details. In order to merge the two different styles in a cohesive way, I added coloured backgrounds and rounded corners to those images to give them an element of playfulness that is compatible with the design of the rest of the website.

Trouble

I ran into a lot of trouble during this project. Troubles of all sorts. After I had chosen my subject I spent too much time trying to figure out how to plan. Realising that I was taking a bit too long to finalise my plan I had to start coding even without a clear plan. Because of that, my code was messy and all over the place. I also realised that there was a lot of things that I still didn’t understand how they worked.
Eventually, things did settle a bit and I was able to focus on what was essential.
