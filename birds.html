                <p>What can we say about blackbirds? Well, the male is
                    black but the female is brown but the female is not called brownbird. Blackbirds like
                    feeding on the ground. They have a beautiful bright orange bill.

                <p>I was doing some work last winter when I spotted a bird I hadn't
                    seen in my garden before. It had a black cap. Yes, that also happened to be his name: Mr
                    Blackcap. From that day on he came back everyday. He was
                    particularly fond of the fat balls. Then one day another bird that I hadn't seen in my
                    garden
                    before appeared. Well, this one had a brownish red cap. It turned out she was Mr Blackcap's
                    wife. And,
                    just like the female she goes by her husband's name, Mrs Blackcap, and NOT Brownishredcap.

                <p>Blue Tits are cute. And cheeky. And they have this dark stripe on their eyes that make them
                    look like bandits. We moved houses last year in January and one of the first things I did
                    when we moved in was to make a bird feeding area. Very soon it proved highly popular and to
                    me delight I was getting many many bird visitors. One of them were the blue tits. In spring
                    they started a family. They had 5 chicks. Cute. And once the blue tit chicks were big enough
                    and able to fly they joined
                    their parents in their feeding adventures. That feeding area just happened to be outside our
                    dining room so I can tell you that it was a delight to have our meals at the same time as
                    the family of blue tits.

                <p>Well, those fellows they certainly do remind me of bulls with their stuffed out red chests
                    and elegance. They are small but mighty! And beautiful. In our old house in the country we
                    used to see them much more regularly than around here in Dublin. In fact, I didn't spot my
                    first bullfinch a year after we moved in! But what a surprise when it arrived. Happily Mr
                    Bullfinch came with Mrs Bullfinch, and, let me tell you, she's just as gorgeous as he is
                    although instead she had a greyish brown chest. It's a lovely shade of greyish brown though.

                <h2 id="chaffinch">Chaffinch</h2>
                <p>I have a confession to make now: it took me a while to get into chaffinches. I used to think
                    of
                    them as slightly uninteresting and dull birds. And too common. I guess we were attracting a
                    reasonable number of them in our garden and to me they just had that sort of very ordinary
                    look
                    about them. But that has changed. You see, what happened was that one day they just
                    disappeared.
                    Don't ask me where they went because I don't know. All I know is that they went and didn't
                    come
                    back. Then one day I was sitting out in the garden not doing much of anything (it'spossible
                    I
                    was thinking about the chaffinches and secretly missing them) I spotted... yes, you guessed
                    it,
                    a chaffinch! Now, this one chaffinch was special. He, for it was a male chaffinch, had a
                    kind of
                    a punk crown style. I don't know if he knew that or not but he hit me on the soft spot and
                    from
                    that day on I was hooked.

                <p>Like blue tits, those guys are extremely cute. They have a disproportionately big head for
                    their
                    body size which only adds to their appeal. And let's talk about the colours. Stunning shade
                    of
                    beige on their underside. A stunning black crown with a white stripe at the back. And a
                    stunning
                    very slight tint of aubergine on their wings. Last year they too started a family and
                    brought
                    their babies to the feeder. Although they didn't have as many chicks as the blue tits it was
                    nonetheless still a pleasure to see the whole family hanging out together.

                <h2 id="collared-dove">Collared Dove</h2>
                <p>I am a big fan of collared doves. It was started when we were in the old house. I had a bird
                    feeder there for small birds. But birds are messy eaters and a lot of the food gets spilled.
                    But never wasted, nevermind. And at certain times of the year a pair, always a pair, would
                    come down and eat the seeds off the floor. Fast forward to the present, the collared doves,
                    still in pairs, they come down and eat the scattered seeds of the ground. But the thing is
                    the ones we have over here seem a bit more acrobaticals than the previous one and they will
                    go up and balance on branches just to have a go at the seeds and fat balls straight off the
                    feeders. Fascinating. But the thing I like most about them is because they remind me of the
                    detectives Thompson and Thomson.
