                <p>What can we say about blackbirds? Well, the male is
                    black but the female is brown but the female is not called brownbird. Blackbirds like
                    feeding on the ground. They have a beautiful bright orange bill.

                <p>I was doing some work last winter when I spotted a bird I hadn't
                    seen in my garden before. It had a black cap. Yes, that also happened to be his name: Mr
                    Blackcap. From that day on he came back everyday. He was
                    particularly fond of the fat balls. Then one day another bird that I hadn't seen in my
                    garden
                    before appeared. Well, this one had a brownish red cap. It turned out she was Mr Blackcap's
                    wife. And,
                    just like the female she goes by her husband's name, Mrs Blackcap, and NOT Brownishredcap.

                <br>
                <p>Blue Tits are cute. And cheeky. And they have this dark stripe on their eyes that make them
                    look like bandits. We moved houses last year in January and one of the first things I did
                    when we moved in was to make a bird feeding area. Very soon it proved highly popular and to
                    me delight I was getting many many bird visitors. One of them were the blue tits. In spring
                    they started a family. They had 5 chicks. Cute. And once the blue tit chicks were big enough
                    and able to fly they joined
                    their parents in their feeding adventures. That feeding area just happened to be outside our
                    dining room so I can tell you that it was a delight to have our meals at the same time as
                    the family of blue tits.

                <br>
                <p>Well, those fellows they certainly do remind me of bulls with their stuffed out red chests
                    and elegance. They are small but mighty! And beautiful. In our old house in the country we
                    used to see them much more regularly than around here in Dublin. In fact, I didn't spot my
                    first bullfinch a year after we moved in! But what a surprise when it arrived. Happily Mr
                    Bullfinch came with Mrs Bullfinch, and, let me tell you, she's just as gorgeous as he is
                    although instead she had a greyish brown chest. It's a lovely shade of greyish brown though.

                <br>
                <p>I have a confession to make now: it took me a while to get into chaffinches. I used to think
                    of
                    them as slightly uninteresting and dull birds. And too common. I guess we were attracting a
                    reasonable number of them in our garden and to me they just had that sort of very ordinary
                    look
                    about them. But that has changed. You see, what happened was that one day they just
                    disappeared.
                    Don't ask me where they went because I don't know. All I know is that they went and didn't
                    come
                    back. Then one day I was sitting out in the garden not doing much of anything (it'spossible
                    I
                    was thinking about the chaffinches and secretly missing them) I spotted... yes, you guessed
                    it,
                    a chaffinch! Now, this one chaffinch was special. He, for it was a male chaffinch, had a
                    kind of
                    a punk crown style. I don't know if he knew that or not but he hit me on the soft spot and
                    from
                    that day on I was hooked.

                <br>
                <p>Like blue tits, those guys are extremely cute. They have a disproportionately big head for
                    their
                    body size which only adds to their appeal. And let's talk about the colours. Stunning shade
                    of
                    beige on their underside. A stunning black crown with a white stripe at the back. And a
                    stunning
                    very slight tint of aubergine on their wings. Last year they too started a family and
                    brought
                    their babies to the feeder. Although they didn't have as many chicks as the blue tits it was
                    nonetheless still a pleasure to see the whole family hanging out together.

                <br>
                <p>I am a big fan of collared doves. It was started when we were in the old house. I had a bird
                    feeder there for small birds. But birds are messy eaters and a lot of the food gets spilled.
                    But never wasted, nevermind. And at certain times of the year a pair, always a pair, would
                    come down and eat the seeds off the floor. Fast forward to the present, the collared doves,
                    still in pairs, they come down and eat the scattered seeds of the ground. But the thing is
                    the ones we have over here seem a bit more acrobaticals than the previous one and they will
                    go up and balance on branches just to have a go at the seeds and fat balls straight off the
                    feeders. Fascinating. But the thing I like most about them is because they remind me of the
                    detectives Thompson and Thomson.

                <br>
                <p>Dunnocks are very discreet birds. They’re so discreet and unassuming that I only started noticing
                    them last year. The story goes like that: one day I noticed a little mouse in the garden. The mouse
                    was attracted to the bird seeds that inevitably got scattered all over the ground because birds are
                    messy eaters. Now, I love mice and this one was cute. Soon there was more than one mouse around.
                    Then there was a family of mice, babies and all. You might be wondering why I’m telling a story
                    about mice in my garden and that’s a fair question. The point is, instead of looking up I started to
                    look down as well. And by doing that I noticed a little bird that was very much like the mice eating
                    the bird food. Yes, dunnocks like the ground. And they move around a bit like mice do. And to watch
                    them pattering on the ground while looking for food and really bothering much with the fancy
                    acrobatics in the air reassures me that it’s quite alright to be just who you are.

                <br>
                <p>Oh the story of the goldfinches! Those beautiful birds with those beautifully unusual colours!
                    Goldfinches are very elegant little birds. And they always come in pairs. And because I love them so
                    much and there aren’t that many of them around nowadays I buy this special seed mix that contains a
                    type of seed that the goldfinches really love. They called nyjer seeds. They’re tiny and black and
                    nobody else seems to like them. So last year they would come everyday together. Well, they would
                    land in the feed about a few seconds apart. The cute thing though is that whoever got there first
                    would wait for the other before it started eating. They disappeared for a while and one day they
                    came back with their offspring. They arrived together in the same manner: one after the other within
                    a few seconds apart and they all waited until everyone was there to start eating. Then after that
                    they disappeared for good. I didn’t see them for months and missed them terribly and I couldn’t help
                    but fear the worst. Then one day one of them came back. The next day there were two, then the day
                    after another one came along and they just kept on coming, more and more of them. They were probably
                    just holidaying or something like that.

                <p>Herons are such elegant, confident and imposing birds, whether they are flying or just quietly
                    standing. When I was living in the west of Ireland, there was a river behind our house. We used to
                    have a very special visitor that would come regularly for freshly caught fish and mussels at certain
                    times of the year: the grey heron. Actually, there were two grey herons. Unfortunately for us and
                    for the herons, our dogs would go wild every time one of the herons landed within their sights and
                    they would take off and find a more peaceful spot. Happily herons are fairly common in the Dublin
                    area as well. I often see them when I walk on the sea front. Just the other day, I saw an
                    interesting spectacle of a grey heron graceously fliying and fighting the bully seagulls that were
                    trying to get his fish from him.

                <br>
                <p>House sparrows are peculiar. First of all, let me just set the record straight: I think they are
                    beautiful and I love them. They’re robust and bold little fellows. The male and the female are
                    different, with the male having beautiful deep shades of brown and reddish brown on its wings and
                    the females with softer tones but just as beautiful. Now I’ll tell why I think house sparrows are
                    peculiar. Well, at least the ones that live nearby. One day they come. And they stay. So I see them
                    all the time for a while. It could be for a few days or several weeks, it really varies. And then
                    they disappear. Again, they disappear for a few days or several weeks. I don’t know where they go
                    and what they do but they always come back and that’s ok.

                <br>
                <p>I've said this before and I'll say it again: I (possibly) love all birds and I think they're all
                    beautiful but the kingfisher is a special one for me. My spotify username is kingfisher_. My GitHub
                    username is cruidin which is Irish for kingfisher. My twitter username is cruidin1 (someone else got
                    there before me... oh well). So with that said let's move on to the story - another one from my West
                    of Ireland years. When we moved to our house in the West, somebody told us that there was a
                    kingfisher nearby. But you see, kingfishers are not easy to spot. They're small birds and they're
                    very fast. The only thing that makes them a bit less hard to spot is their stunningly colourful
                    plummage. So the very odd time I would be sitting near the river just looking around and I would see
                    a blur of bright colours. Kingfisher! - my first thought. It has to be. And it probably was. That
                    didn't happen a lot, only a handful of times in the five years I was there. Then one day something
                    very tragic happened. A kingfisher crashed into our window. And it died. We were ver saddened by
                    that. Before we offered it a river burial (that's what we did whenever a bird died) we had the
                    privilege to really look at it closely and fully appreciate its beauty.

                <br>
                <p>This one unfortunately is a sad story. I actually haven’t really encounter this special bird until
                    the day I found one in my little boy’s bedroom who had sadly flown into the bedroom and crashed into
                    the wall. So we found it dead on the floor. It was summer of 2020 and we were growing lots of
                    sunflowers that year so we decided to bury it with one of the sunflowers that we planted. I’m
                    pleased to say that this one particular sunflower turned out
                    very nice indeed. I’m still living in hope to see more long tailed tits around but the day hasn’t
                    come yet.

                    but the reality is that I don't think I've ever seen or heard one in my life. But I have seen mistle
                    thrushes. They don't come very often but when they do they seem to bring a sense of novelty to life.
                    I can't really explain what it is about them that make me feel that way.

                <p>One of the things that got me through the whole lockdown business was birds. Another thing was
                    gardening. And Jonathan Richman. But the latter has got nothing to do with the story. So back to
                    birds and gardening, last year we were growing vegetables and at some point in the spring/summer
                    time when the vegetables needed a lot of water due to lack of rain I had to water them regularly.
                    One day while I was watering the plants, a cheeky little bird appeared from out of nowhere. And it
                    started to follow me very closely. It would come back and stay with me whenever it saw me watering
                    the plants. This cheeky little bird was a juvenile robin and although it didn't have that nice fiery
                    orange breast robins are known for it already had a lot of caracter and it kept me happy and in good
                    company.

                <br>
                <p>I see an increase in the starling population this year. I may, or I may not, have something to do
                    with that, I'm afraid. Talking about starlings is a complicated matter. They are stunning birds with
                    really cool iridescent colours and spots all over. They perform one of the most mysterious and
                    fascinating shows in the skies where they group together in one giant flock and do an eerie dance -
                    I've only seen it once and I still thing about it. But starlings are also noisy. And messy. And
                    rude. And they eat all the food that I buy! Having said that, I almost dont't mind that because I
                    keep reminding myself that maybe, just maybe, there's a small, or even a tiny chance that they might
                    perform a little dance for me at some stage. Do you think they will. Nah...

                <br>
                <p>Now I like those fellows. They're funny, curious looking and big! The story I have of them is a silly
                    one. When I was setting up my new bird feeding area I bought different types of feeders. One of them
                    was a feeder in the shape of a house that was open on all four sides. That one proved quite popular
                    amongst all birds, including the woodpigeon despite the fact that they weren't really made for birds
                    that big. Now this feeder was hanging on the branch of a dead tree. The woodpigeon were really so
                    keen on eating those seeds straight from the source that they started practicing landing inside the
                    little house. And what an entertaining thing to watch, let me tell you! And eventually they did
                    master it and everytime they landed neatly inside it the house would swing from side to side a good
                    few times before it came to a halt and the woodpigeon would have its feast.
