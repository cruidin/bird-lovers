        <h2>What are birds?</h2>
        <p>Birds are everywhere. Wherever you go you’re sure to find birds. Even if you don’t go anywhere you can just look outside your window and you will find a feathered creature doing acrobatics in the air or hear the beautiful tunes that they like to play. 
Birds have been also an endless source of wonder (and dare I say envy) for humans since we existed. It’s also possible that other creatures that came before us were also a bit envious of birds and their beauty and their free nature. But that’s just speculation.

        <h2>Why should you bother looking at birds and where to find them?</h2>
        <p>Now if you’re not a birder (yet!), here are a few reasons why you might want to become one. First of all, you don’t really have to get all fancy to go birdwatching. All you need is your eyes and your ears, and if you only have access to one or the other that’s more than enough too. You see, birdwatching is for everyone: it doesn’t matter where you’re from, your age, your gender, your colour, whether you have money or not. And by the way, birds don’t care about that sort of thing either. So when we stop and start noticing birds we are invited to enter a different realm: the realm of magic, beauty and freedom. Just start watching whatever bird is flying above you. Just start listening to whatever sounds and music they are making. Tune in to the bird world and allow yourself to get lost, even if it’s just for a few seconds.
