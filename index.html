                <h2 class="bird-name">What are birds?</h2><br>
                <p>Birds are everywhere. Wherever you go you’re sure to find birds. Even if you don’t go anywhere you
                    can
                    just
                    look outside your window and you will find a feathered creature doing acrobatics in the air or hear
                    the
                    beautiful tunes that they like to play.
                    Birds have been also an endless source of wonder (and dare I say envy) for humans since we existed.
                    It’s
                    also possible that other creatures that came before us were also a bit envious of birds and their
                    beauty
                    and
                    their free nature. But that’s just speculation. <a href="birds.html">more</a></p>

                <h2 id="why" class="bird-name">Why would you bother looking at birds?</h2><br>
                <p>Now if you’re not a birder (yet!), here are a few reasons why you might want to become one. First of
                    all,
                    you
                    don’t really have to get all fancy to go birdwatching. All you need is your eyes and your ears, and
                    if
                    you
                    only have access to one or the other that’s more than enough too. You see, birdwatching is for
                    everyone:
                    it
                    doesn’t matter where you’re from, your age, your gender, your colour, whether you have money or not.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>And
                    by
                    the way, birds don’t care about that sort of thing either. So when we stop and start noticing birds
                    we
                    are
                    invited to enter a different realm: the realm of magic, beauty and freedom. Just start watching
                    whatever
                    bird is flying above you. Just start listening to whatever sounds and music they are making. Tune in
                    to
                    the
                    bird world and allow yourself to get lost, even if it’s just for a few seconds.

                <p>There are endless activities that you can do using birds as an inspiration. Some of them are pretty
                    obvious
                    like birdwatching or gardening to bring more birds and wildlife to your garden and they're all
                    excellent
                    things to do. I am listing just a few to get you started... <a href="activities.html">more</a></p>

                <p>Hi! First of all, I'm not a bird but I might as well have been one in a previous life. That portrait
                    there is of what I would wish my portrait looked like if I were a bird.
                    <br>Now, back to who I really am! My name is Patricia and I like drawing, perfoming and coding. I
                    also love birds and I have lots
                    of
                    them who come to visit me everyday in my garden.
                    <br>So in fact, I'm just an ordinary human being but I did once pretend to be a duck and I felt
                    pretty good about that. <br><br>What bird would you like to be?</p>
